    "# Intro to Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Mathematics for Data Scientists! In this tutorial, we'll review introductory statistics and linear algebra needed for a career in data science. This isn't meant to be a comprehensive guide, but rather a great starting point to get you started on your data science career.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first section, we'll begin by asking ourselves, \"What *is* statistics?\" It's very likely that you've heard of statistics before, whether that be in an article, results for a test grade in school, or pretty much any other context. But to put it formally, statistics is a discipline that uses data to support claims about populations. You'll come to learn that these \"populations\" are what we refer to as \"distributions.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Most statistical analysis is based on probability, which is why these pieces are usually presented together. More often than not, you'll see courses labeled \"Intro to Probability and Statistics\" rather than separate intro to probability and intro to statistics courses. This is because probability is the study of random events, or the study of how likely it is that some event will happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technology\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll be using Python to show how different statistical concepts can be done computationally. Specifically, we'll be working with `scipy` and `numpy`, two scientific computing modules in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, statistics is split into two subfields: descriptive and inferential. The difference is subtle, but important. Descriptive statistics refer to the portion of statistics dedicated to summarizing a total population. Inferential Statistics, on the other hand, allows us to make inferences of a population from its *subpopulation*. Unlike descriptive statistics, inferential statistics are never 100% accurate because its calculations are measured without the total population."

    "# Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, to review, descriptive statistics refers to the statistical tools used to summarize a dataset. One of the first operations often used to get a sense of what a given data looks like is the `mean` operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mean \n",
    "\n",
    "You know what the mean is, you've heard it every time your computer science professor handed your midterms back and announced that the average, or *mean* was a disappointing low of 59. Woops. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, the “average” is just one of many summary statistics you might choose to describe the typical value or the **central tendency** of a sample. You can find the formal mathematical definition right below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mu = \\frac{1}{n} \\Sigma_i x_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing the mean isn't a fun task, especially if you have hundreds, even *thousands* of data points to compute the mean for. You definitely don't want to do this by hand, right? \n",
    "\n",
    "Right. In Python, you can either implement your own mean function, or you can use `numpy`. We'll begin with our own implementation so you can get a thorough understanding of how these sorts of functions are implemented. Below, `t` is a list of datapoints, so you can use built-in list functions such as `sum()` and `len()` to compute the total sum and divide by the total number of data points. "
